# Hour Ahead Electricity Load Forecasting In A Fifteen-Minute Interval Using Artificial Neural Networks For Power Utilities

I'm just trying to preserve copies of my projects. Including the ancient ones.  
This is a system made in a very short time (less than 2 months) parallel with thesis writing and defenses.

## Installation

Just import using existing General Project. This was written when I had no industry best practices knowledge. Please excuse the spaghetti code :(

- Import the needed libraries manually under /lib if there are errors after project import.
- Import the DB backup under db_backup.

## Usage

- Login using sample:sample username and password.
- Pick either of the 4 options in the main menu.
